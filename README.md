# Passion Fruit Disease Detection

I tried to create an accurate machine learning models capable of localizing and identifying multiple Passion Fruits in a single image, and classify the disease status of those fruits. For this task, i used Faster-Rcnn to detect the fruits, and Streamlit to creat a web app for this task. This model is quite successful knowing that creating accurate machine learning models capable of localizing and identifying multiple objects in a single image remains a core challenge in computer vision.
